  I'm surrounded by failing hardware. UPS that "protects" my home server has a dead battery. Router at my parents' home has a dead power supply.

  Such small failures are tiresome to fix. Frankly, it's cheaper and easier to toss bad device to a landfill than to fix it.

  Yeah. Landfills. I'll try to remember about them next time I'm grumpy with a multimeter in hand
